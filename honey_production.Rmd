##### This data set is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production/data

##### It shows  honey production numbers and prices by state from 1998-2012


# Summary plots

Below are spaghetti plots for each state over time. Number of colonies, total production, and product value over time are examined.

```{r load_data}
library(readr)
honeyproduction <- read_csv("honey-production/honeyproduction.csv")
```

```{r some_plots}
library(ggplot2)

p1 = ggplot(honeyproduction, aes(year, numcol, color = state)) + 
  geom_path()
print(p1)

p2 = ggplot(honeyproduction, aes(year, totalprod, color = state)) + 
  geom_path()
print(p2)

p3 = ggplot(honeyproduction, aes(year, prodvalue, color = state)) + 
  geom_path()
print(p3)
```
